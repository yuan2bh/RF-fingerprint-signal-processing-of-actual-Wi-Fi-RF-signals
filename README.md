# RF-fingerprint-signal-processing-of-actual-Wi-Fi-RF-signals  

The D-Link Wi-Fi 802.11b network adapter is set to Ad-hoc mode, and the short preamble keeps appearing. The preamble RF signal is acquired with an RF oscilloscope at a sample volume of 20 Gigabits per second, and the saved signal data is processed with these MATLAB programs in a PC to obtain an RF fingerprint for wireless physical-layer security.

RF signals are decoded into I and Q channels by low-pass filtering, downconversion, and soft Phase Locked Loop (PLL), with the I channel decoded to compare standard preambles. For details, see two published papers [1-3]:
